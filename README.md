# DISCRIPTION ABOUT THIS PROJECT
Project Title: --Basic Command-Line Chatbot using Python--

Project Description (Approx. 300–350 words): This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python that interacts with users via the command-line interface. It is designed to respond to basic inputs like greetings, questions about its identity, and general phrases. The goal of this chatbot is to demonstrate how conditional logic and basic string handling in Python can be used to simulate human-like conversation at a foundational level.

The chatbot works by accepting user input using the input() function and analyzing the message through a series of conditional checks using if-elif-else statements. The responses are hard-coded and triggered based on specific keywords or phrases such as "hello", "how are you", or "bye". If the input matches any known pattern, a predefined response is returned. If not, a default message is shown indicating the chatbot didn’t understand the input.
